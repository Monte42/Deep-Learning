    "## Feature Scaling And Splitting The Data\n",
    "There has been some discussion on if we should split the data before or after the feature scaling.\\\n",
    "I would like to take a minute and explain why we do it before we scale the features.\\\n",
    "\\\n",
    "When we get our raw dataset it can have all kinds of values stored in it.\\\n",
    "Up to now we converted categorized data into values of 1's and 0's,\\\n",
    "and filled in the empty cells, but we could have some colums with a large difference in values.\\\n",
    "For example, think of age and salary.  Age is <100 while salary is in the 1000's.\\\n",
    "\\\n",
    "The data we pass to the training model will need each column changed so all the values are in a comparable range.\\\n",
    "Lets say values between -3/+3, or 0/1.\\\n",
    "\\\n",
    "We are going to talk about 2 of the main types of feature scaling.\\\n",
    "First I want to say I'm not a mathematician, but I will explain the best way I know how.\\\n",
    "We are about to see an x a single quote above it, that is signifying \"The new cell value of this iteration of x in an array of x's\".\\\n",
    "Also its very import to remeber, scaling is column based.\n",
    "### Normalization\n",
    "> #### $X^{'}=\\frac{x-x_{min}}{x_{max}-x_{min}}$\n",
    "This is the Normalization formular used for scaling our data.\\\n",
    "Whats being said here is, the new value of x is the current value of x minus the min of whole list divided by the list max minus the list min.\\\n",
    "Lets apply this to a few exaples in the age column of our dataset.\\\n",
    "- MIN: 27\n",
    "- MAX: 50\n",
    ">#### $X^{'}=\\frac{27-27}{50-27}=\\frac{0}{23}=0.0$\n",
    "In this example we entered the min age into the formula, and 0 was the answer\n",
    ">#### $X^{'}=\\frac{50-27}{50-27}=\\frac{23}{23}=1.0$\n",
    "In this example we entered the max age into the formula, and we got 1 for the answer\n",
    ">#### $X^{'}=\\frac{38-27}{50-27}=\\frac{11}{23}=0.478$\n",
    "Here I grabbed a random age of 38. We got a value that was between 1 and 0.\\\n",
    "This will work with any age in the data set. It also works the same on the salary column.\n",
    "### Standardization\n",
    "> #### $X^{'}=\\frac{x-\\mu}{\\sigma}$\n",
    "Here is our standardization formula.\\\n",
    "This one will be a little harder to explain.\\\n",
    "Here, new value of X is the current value of X minus the mean(average) of the list divided by the standard deviation.\\\n",
    "So what is the \"Standard Deviation\"?\\\n",
    "Its a measure of how dispersed the data is in relation to its mean.\\\n",
    "Mathematically, it's the square root of the ((sum of ((each value minus the mean) squared)) divided by the number of values in the dataset).\n",
    "> #### $\\sigma=\\sqrt{\\frac{\\Sigma(x^{i}-\\mu)^{2}}{N}}$\n",
    "So now, our formula looks more like this.\\\n",
    "so first we solve for standard deviation, then solve for $X^{'}$\n",
    "> #### $X^{'}=\\frac{x-\\mu}{\\sqrt{\\frac{\\Sigma(x^{i}-\\mu)^{2}}{N}}}$\n",
    "Needless to say I wont be running examples of this one in this section.\\\n",
    "\\\n",
    "By now, I'm sure you're wondering why go through all this?\\\n",
    "Well, as mentioned before in our dataset the age column and salary columns have very different size values.\\\n",
    "We don't want the much larger integer values of the salary over power the age column.\\\n",
    "Lets look at a visual example.\\\n",
    "![DataPrep](./img/data_prep(1).png)\\\n",
    "If you were asked to group row 2 with, or who 2 was closer to on a general scale who would you pick?\\\n",
    "\\\n",
    "Well, lets first look at the differences and the compare.\\\n",
    "![DataPrep](./img/data_prep(2).png)\\\n",
    "We can see the salary difference between row 1 and 2 is $10,000 while row 2 and 3 is $8,000.\\\n",
    "If we compare the differences theres a gap of 2000.\\\n",
    "For age the diffence from 1 and 2 is 1, while the diffence from 2 and three is 4.\\\n",
    "This gives a gap of 3.\\\n",
    "So, we want to say person 2 is closer to person 3 because 2000 os so much larger than 3.\\\n",
    "\\\n",
    "Now lets see what happens after we apply normalization.\\\n",
    "![DataPrep](./img/data_prep(3).png)\\\n",
    "That looks different!\\\n",
    "Now we can easliy see that person sits about in the middle as far as salary is concerned.\\\n",
    "Age on the otherhand, is much closer to person 1.\\\n",
    "So now we can clearly and confidently group person 2 with person 1.\\\n",
    "The same applies to our learning model.\n",
    "### Ok so which do we preform first, split the data or feature scaling?\n",
    "Now that we understand feature scaling, we can tackle this question.\\\n",
    "The idea of a test set is to have data that have both the independent and dependent variables.\\\n",
    "This way we can enter single observations, get the predicted outcome, and compare it to what actually happend.\\\n",
    "\\\n",
    "As we now know when we apply feature scaling, we are working with min's, max's or mean's.\\\n",
    "This means if our test data can contaminate the feature scaling results.\\\n",
    "This is actually called \"data leakage\", remember we don't want our model to have any contact with the test data.\\\n",
    "Another thing to consider is once the model is deployed other than handeling categorical data, we won't scale new data.\\\n",
    "\\\n",
    "I think now the answer is obvious which has to be done first now.  Which is, splitting the data."
